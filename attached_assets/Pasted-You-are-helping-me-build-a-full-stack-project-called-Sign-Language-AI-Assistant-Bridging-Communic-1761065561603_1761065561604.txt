You are helping me build a full-stack project called “Sign Language AI Assistant – Bridging Communication through AI and Gesture Recognition”.

🧩 Overview:
This system bridges communication between speech-impaired users and digital devices using sign language. It combines:
• A webcam for gesture capture
• A smart glove with flex/finger sensors
• An Arduino or ESP32 microcontroller
• A .NET backend for AI logic
• A React + Vite frontend for the UI

⚙️ Functional Goal:
The app should recognize hand gestures (from camera + sensors), interpret them through AI, and perform actions or display translated text in real time.  
For example, if the user signs “Message Robin”, it should interpret that and trigger a sample action like sending or displaying that message.

### 💻 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (make it PWA-ready)
**Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8.0 (Web API)
**AI Layer:** OpenAI API for language understanding
**Hardware:** Arduino/ESP32 + Flex Sensors (via Serial or Bluetooth)
**Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL
**Hosting:** Frontend → Vercel, Backend → Render/Azure
**Tools:** Replit, Visual Studio, Arduino IDE

### 🔧 Core Features to Build
1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - Real-time dashboard showing gesture detection results.
   - Display AI-interpreted text (like “Sending message to Robin…”).
   - Optional voice output using text-to-speech.

2. **Backend (.NET Web API)**
   - Endpoint to receive sensor + camera data.
   - Integrate OpenAI API for contextual understanding.
   - Return processed command or text output to frontend.

3. **Hardware Module (Arduino/ESP32)**
   - Read flex sensor values.
   - Send JSON data via Serial or Bluetooth (e.g. `{ "thumb": 230, "index": 180, ... }`).
   - Optional: trigger a calibration mode.

4. **AI Integration**
   - Use OpenAI API to interpret intent (e.g., “open WhatsApp”, “play music”).
   - Map interpreted commands to functions or sample actions.

5. **End-to-End Flow**
   - User performs a gesture.
   - Camera + glove data → backend.
   - Backend → AI model → interpret → execute.
   - Frontend → shows or speaks the output.

### 📦 Expected Output
- Working web UI that updates live as gestures are recognized.
- Backend API endpoints for sensor and AI interaction.
- Arduino sketch for reading and transmitting flex sensor data.
- Full integration where gestures translate into text or commands.

### 🎯 Goal
Generate a modular project skeleton that includes:
- Folder setup for `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/hardware`
- Boilerplate React app with a simple dashboard
- ASP.NET backend with placeholder AI routes (`/api/gesture`, `/api/interpret`)
- Arduino sketch to simulate sensor input (for now)
- Comments where integration points will go

Keep the code clean, modular, and ready for expansion.  
I’ll be coding this interactively and connecting each part manually as I progress.
